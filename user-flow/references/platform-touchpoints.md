# Platform Touchpoints — Surface Catalog

> Exhaustive inventory of the surfaces a product can occupy on every major platform. A **flow touches a surface** when the user can enter, advance, or receive feedback for that flow via that surface. Use this catalog at Step 0 to enumerate which surfaces a flow will occupy, then require the structure, wireframe, and edge-case agents to map each selected surface explicitly.

## How to use this file

1. **At interview time:** Ask the user to pick platforms, then for each platform pick surfaces from the lists below. Nothing on this list is optional-by-default — a surface is either in scope (must be mapped) or explicitly out of scope (noted in the artifact).
2. **At structure-mapping time:** For every selected surface, define the entry trigger, the pre-state data loaded, the screens or controls shown, and the handoff back into the main flow.
3. **At wireframing time:** Render a mini-frame at the surface's native dimensions (see each platform section for typical widths / line budgets).
4. **At edge-case time:** Walk the per-surface failure modes listed under each surface.

Each surface entry below follows the same shape:

- **Surface** — name as users / docs know it
- **Entry triggers** — user actions that bring the flow in via this surface
- **Typical flow role** — whether this surface starts flows, advances flows, or just surfaces state
- **Native dimensions** — rough wireframe size when it makes sense
- **Edge states to check** — surface-specific failure modes beyond the standard five

## Using this catalog at the interview

Required prompts at Step 0 — the orchestrator must answer **all four** before dispatching Layer 1:

1. **Target platforms** — pick one or more from: macOS · iOS · iPadOS · Android · Windows · web-desktop · web-mobile · watchOS · tvOS · visionOS · CarPlay · Android Auto · Linux. *"Cross-platform"* is not an acceptable answer — list every platform it ships on.
2. **Per-platform surfaces in scope** — for each selected platform, pick every surface from the catalog that will carry this flow. Surfaces not picked are explicitly out of scope.
3. **Cross-platform channels in scope** — pick any channel from the Cross-platform table that the flow uses (email, SMS, push, calendar, etc.).
4. **Primary surface per platform** — which one surface is the flow's main entry on that platform (used to pick the default wireframe size).

Record the answers in the artifact's "Target Platforms & Surfaces" matrix. If the user says "all surfaces" or similar, push back — the enumeration exists because a flow that tries to occupy every surface fails all of them.

## Reference notes

- iOS / iPadOS surfaces follow Apple's developer docs for widgets, Live Activities, App Intents, App Clips, extensions, Focus filters. Exact APIs change per major OS — verify for the target minimum OS version when the flow is implemented.
- Android surfaces follow AOSP and Jetpack docs; OEM-specific surfaces (Samsung Edge, Xiaomi MIUI controls) are flagged but not universal.
- macOS NSStatusItem / menu-bar-extra guidance assumes modern SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra` (macOS 13+) or AppKit NSStatusItem.
- Windows UWP / Win32 / packaged-MSIX paths differ — the "Share target" and some widget/tile surfaces require packaged identity.
- When in doubt about an API, fetch current docs via Context7 rather than memorizing signatures.
