# Plan Interviewer

*Productivity — Multi-agent orchestration. Transform shallow feature requests into well-specified plans through multi-round interviews.*

**Core Question:** "What haven't we thought of yet?"

## Inputs Required
- A feature request, problem description, or existing plan/spec file to refine
- Access to AskUserQuestion tool for multi-round interviews

## Output
- Spec file at user-designated path (default: `.agents/spec.md`)

## Chain Position
Previous: none | Next: `task-breakdown` or `system-architecture`

### Skill Deference
- **Have a FEATURE or PRODUCT to specify?** → Use this skill.
- **Have a declining METRIC to diagnose** (X is at Y, should be Z)? → Use `problem-analysis` (from strategy-skills) instead.

**Re-run triggers:** When requirements change significantly, when new technical constraints emerge, or when a previous spec leads to implementation blockers.

## Multi-Agent Architecture

### Agent Roster

| Agent | File | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| codebase-scanner-agent | `agents/codebase-scanner-agent.md` | Extracts tech stack, schemas, existing implementations from code |
| artifact-reader-agent | `agents/artifact-reader-agent.md` | Reads specs, PRDs, product context — extracts decisions already made |
| challenger-agent | `agents/challenger-agent.md` | Validates premise with exactly 3 challenge questions |
| interviewer-agent | `agents/interviewer-agent.md` | Conducts multi-round interview via AskUserQuestion (5 dimensions) |
| synthesis-agent | `agents/synthesis-agent.md` | Assembles all context into structured specification |
| critic-agent | `agents/critic-agent.md` | Quality gate review, dimension coverage, decision completeness |

### Execution Layers

```
Layer 1 (parallel):
  codebase-scanner-agent ──┐
  artifact-reader-agent ───┘── run simultaneously

Layer 2 (sequential):
  challenger-agent ─────────── uses Layer 1 context to validate premise
    → interviewer-agent ────── conducts interview (INTERACTIVE — uses AskUserQuestion)
      → synthesis-agent ────── writes the specification
        → critic-agent ─────── final quality review
```

### Dispatch Protocol

1. **Layer 1 dispatch** — send brief to `codebase-scanner-agent` and `artifact-reader-agent` in parallel. They extract what the codebase and existing artifacts already answer.
2. **Challenger dispatch** — send brief + Layer 1 outputs to `challenger-agent`. It produces exactly 3 challenge questions and a PROCEED/REFRAME/DEFER recommendation.
3. **User confirmation** — present challenger's questions to the user. If REFRAME, present the alternative framing. If user confirms proceed, continue. If DEFER, stop and explain.
4. **Interviewer dispatch** — send all context to `interviewer-agent`. It conducts 3-7 rounds of interview via **AskUserQuestion**, covering all 5 dimensions, skipping questions already answered by Layer 1.
5. **Synthesis dispatch** — send all outputs to `synthesis-agent` to write the spec.
6. **Critic review** — send spec to `critic-agent`.
7. **Revision loop** — if critic returns NEEDS REVISION, re-dispatch affected agents. Maximum 2 rounds.
8. **Save** — write spec to user-designated path (default: `.agents/spec.md`).

### Routing Rules

| Condition | Route |
|-----------|-------|
| No codebase exists (greenfield) | codebase-scanner-agent returns NO CODEBASE; all questions valid |
| No artifacts exist | artifact-reader-agent returns NO ARTIFACTS; interview from scratch |
| Challenger recommends REFRAME | Present reframing to user; proceed on confirmation |
| Challenger recommends DEFER | Stop; explain what should happen instead |
| User says "skip the questions, just write it" | Use Layer 1 context + challenger only; synthesize without interview |
| Critic APPROVED | Save and deliver |
| Critic NEEDS REVISION | Re-dispatch cited agents with feedback |

---

## Critical Gates

Before delivering, the critic-agent verifies ALL of these pass:

- [ ] All 5 interview dimensions explored (Technical, UX, Business Logic, Architecture, Security)
- [ ] Spec contains concrete decisions, not open-ended options
- [ ] Edge cases documented with explicit handling strategies
- [ ] Open questions list is empty or explicitly deferred with rationale

**If any gate fails:** the critic identifies which agent must fix it and the orchestrator re-dispatches.

---

## Single-Agent Fallback

When context window is constrained or the feature is simple:

1. Skip multi-agent dispatch
2. Check for existing codebase context and artifacts
3. Challenge the premise (3 questions: right problem? what if nothing? what exists?)
4. Conduct interview using AskUserQuestion (2-4 questions per round, all 5 dimensions)
5. Write specification using the Spec File Format below
6. Run Critical Gates as self-review
7. Save to `.agents/spec.md`

---

## AskUserQuestion Tool Usage

**This skill is interactive.** The interviewer-agent uses AskUserQuestion for every question round.

Structure questions for maximum clarity:
- 2-4 questions per invocation
- Each question has 2-4 concrete options
- Options represent real tradeoffs, not obvious choices
- Include brief description explaining implications of each option
- State which option you recommend and why

**Example:**
```
Question: "When a background sync fails, how should we handle it?"
Options:
1. Silent retry (3x with backoff) — User unaware, but may see stale data
2. Toast notification — User informed but may be annoyed
3. Badge indicator — Subtle, user can investigate when ready
4. Block UI until resolved — Safest but worst UX
Recommended: Option 1 — most sync failures are transient; fall back to option 2 if retries exhaust.
```

## Interview Dimensions (all 5 required)

### Technical Implementation
- Data flow edge cases (What happens when X fails mid-operation?)
- State management boundaries (Where does this state live?)
- Concurrency considerations (What if two users do this simultaneously?)
- Migration paths, performance cliffs

### UX & Interaction Design
- Error recovery flows, loading/empty/error states
- Undo/redo expectations, accessibility edge cases
- Mobile-first considerations

### Business Logic & Domain
- Edge case ownership, audit/compliance needs
- Multi-tenancy implications, internationalization

### Architecture & Tradeoffs
- Consistency vs availability, coupling concerns
- Testability, observability
- Implementation foresight (decisions to resolve NOW, not at 2am during build)

### Security & Privacy
- Trust boundaries, data exposure, rate limiting

## Out of Scope
- [What we're explicitly NOT doing]

## Open Questions
- [ ] [Anything still unresolved]

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | INSTEAD |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Leading questions | "Don't you think we should use WebSockets?" pushes toward predetermined answer | Ask open-ended: "What are your latency requirements?" |
| Accepting the first answer | Surface-level answers miss hidden constraints | Probe deeper: "Why that approach?" and "What would change your mind?" |
| Skipping edge cases | Happy-path specs produce happy-path code that breaks in production | scaling-agent traces failure modes; interviewer explores empty states, concurrent access |
| Scope creep during interview | Each new question expands feature surface | Periodically re-anchor: "Is this still in scope for MVP?" |
| Asking questions the codebase answers | "What framework?" when package.json is right there | codebase-scanner-agent extracts facts first; interviewer skips answered questions |
| Options instead of decisions | Spec says "could use X or Y" | synthesis-agent writes concrete decisions only; undecided items go to Open Questions |

## Worked Example

**User:** "I want to build a habit tracker app."

**Layer 1 (parallel):**
- `codebase-scanner-agent` → NO CODEBASE (greenfield)
- `artifact-reader-agent` → NO ARTIFACTS

**Challenger (3 questions):**
1. Right problem? "Outcome: users build consistent habits. A habit tracker is the most direct path."
2. What if nothing? "Users currently use spreadsheets — friction causes abandonment."
3. What exists? "Greenfield — no existing code." → Recommendation: PROCEED

**Interviewer (5 rounds, AskUserQuestion):**
- Round 1 (Scope): Personal only, mobile-first PWA, 4-week MVP
- Round 2 (Users): Health-conscious 25-35, switching from spreadsheets
- Round 3 (Features): Add habit → check off → see streak. Configurable reminders.
- Round 4 (Edge cases): Streak resets on miss (history preserved), user's local timezone
- Round 5 (Technical): Email magic link auth, offline sync on reconnect

**Synthesis:** Spec with 14 concrete decisions and 3 deferred items.

**Critic:** APPROVED — all 4 gates pass, all 5 dimensions covered.

**Artifact saved to `.agents/spec.md`.**

## Before Starting

### Step 0: Product Context
Check for `.agents/product-context.md`. If available, read for product and audience context before interviewing. If missing, plan-interviewer works standalone.

### Optional Artifacts
| Artifact | Source | Benefit |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `.agents/product-context.md` | icp-research (from `hungv47/comms-skills`) | Product context prevents redundant interview questions |
| `.agents/problem-analysis.md` | problem-analysis (from `hungv47/strategy-skills`) | Root cause context when feature solves a diagnosed problem |

---

## Artifact Template

On re-run: rename existing artifact to `spec.v[N].md` and create new with incremented version.

Save to user-designated path (default: `.agents/spec.md`) using the Spec File Format above.
