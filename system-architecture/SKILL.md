# System Architecture Designer — Orchestrator

*Productivity — Multi-agent orchestration. Transforms product specifications into a comprehensive technical blueprint covering stack, schema, APIs, and deployment.*

**Core Question:** "Will this still work at 10x scale with 10x team?"

## Inputs Required
- Product specification, PRD, or description of what needs to be built
- Scale expectations (users, requests, data volume) — gathered via interview if missing
- Known constraints (existing stack, compliance, budget, team skills)

## Output
- `.agents/system-architecture.md`

## Chain Position
Previous: `discover` or `task-breakdown` (optional) | Next: `task-breakdown` (optional) | Cross-stack: reads `solution-design.md` (from research-skills), `user-flow.md` (from product-skills)

**Re-run triggers:** When product spec changes significantly, when scale requirements change (10x growth), when migrating core infrastructure, or when adding major new integrations.

## Multi-Agent Architecture

### Agent Manifest

| Agent | File | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| stack-selection-agent | `agents/stack-selection-agent.md` | Technology choices with rationale and alternatives |
| infrastructure-agent | `agents/infrastructure-agent.md` | Deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, env vars |
| schema-agent | `agents/schema-agent.md` | Database tables, relationships, indexes, queries |
| api-agent | `agents/api-agent.md` | Endpoints, auth, request/response contracts |
| integration-agent | `agents/integration-agent.md` | File structure, service connections, feature blueprints |
| scaling-agent | `agents/scaling-agent.md` | Bottleneck analysis, failure modes, edge cases |
| critic-agent | `agents/critic-agent.md` | Quality gate review, internal consistency |

### Execution Layers

```
Layer 1 (parallel):
  stack-selection-agent ──┐
  infrastructure-agent ───┘─── run simultaneously

Layer 2 (sequential):
  schema-agent ─────────────── depends on stack choice
    → api-agent ────────────── depends on stack + schema
      → integration-agent ──── depends on stack + schema + API
        → scaling-agent ────── validates everything above
          → critic-agent ───── final quality review
```

### Dispatch Protocol

1. **Gather context** — extract user types, data entities, critical flows, scale profile, and constraints from the product spec. If missing, run the Architecture Interview (see below).
2. **Layer 1 dispatch** — send brief + constraints to `stack-selection-agent` and `infrastructure-agent` in parallel.
3. **Layer 2 sequential chain** — pass stack output to `schema-agent`, then stack + schema to `api-agent`, then all three to `integration-agent`, then everything to `scaling-agent`.
4. **Critic review** — send assembled document to `critic-agent`.
5. **Revision loop** — if critic returns FAIL, re-dispatch affected agents with feedback. Maximum 2 revision rounds.
6. **Assembly** — merge all agent outputs into the 12-section artifact template. Save to `.agents/system-architecture.md`.

### Routing Logic

| Condition | Route |
|-----------|-------|
| User provides tech stack upfront | Skip stack-selection-agent; pass user's stack directly to schema-agent |
| User needs stack recommendations | Run stack-selection-agent first |
| Critic returns PASS | Assemble and deliver |
| Critic returns FAIL | Re-dispatch only the agents cited in critic's issues |
| Revision round > 2 | Deliver with critic's remaining issues noted as Open Questions |

---

## Dependency Classification

When designing integrations and service boundaries, classify every external dependency into one of four categories. Each category has a different testing strategy:

| Category | What it is | Testing strategy | Example |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **In-process** | Pure computation, no I/O | Test directly, no mocks needed | Validation logic, formatters, calculators |
| **Local-substitutable** | Has a lightweight local stand-in | Use the stand-in in tests | PGLite for Postgres, LocalStack for AWS, MailHog for email |
| **Remote but owned** | Your own services | Ports & Adapters — define interface, test with in-memory adapter | Your auth service, your billing API |
| **True external** | Third-party, no stand-in | Mock at the boundary only | Stripe API, Twilio, OpenAI |

Document the category for each dependency in the Service Connections section. This directly informs testing strategy in `task-breakdown` and `review-chain`.

## Critical Gates

Before delivering, the critic-agent verifies ALL of these pass:

- [ ] Every tech choice has a rationale (not just "it's popular")
- [ ] API endpoints exist for every user-facing feature
- [ ] Database schema covers all entities mentioned in product spec
- [ ] Deployment section includes complete env var list
- [ ] File structure matches chosen framework conventions
- [ ] Auth model covers all user roles and permission levels
- [ ] At least one architectural trade-off is documented with alternatives considered
- [ ] Every external dependency is classified (in-process / local-substitutable / remote-owned / true-external)

**If any gate fails:** the critic identifies which agent must fix it and the orchestrator re-dispatches with specific feedback.

---

## Single-Agent Fallback

When context window is constrained or the product is simple (fewer than 3 user types, fewer than 5 data entities):

1. Skip multi-agent dispatch
2. Execute Steps 1-4 from the original process sequentially:
   - Step 1: Gather context and constraints
   - Step 2: Architecture decisions (use `references/tech-stack-patterns.md` and `references/tech-stack-matrix.md`)
   - Step 3: Generate all 12 sections of the architecture document
   - Step 4: Validation cross-reference
3. Run the Critical Gates checklist as self-review
4. Save to `.agents/system-architecture.md`

---

## Before Starting

### Step 0: Product Context

Check for `.agents/product-context.md`. If missing: interview for product dimensions (what, who, problem, differentiator, scale, integrations) and save to `.agents/product-context.md`. Or recommend running `icp-research` (from `hungv47/marketing-skills`) to bootstrap it.

If `.agents/product-context.md` has a `date` field older than 30 days, recommend re-running `icp-research` (from marketing-skills) to refresh it.

### Required Artifacts
None — this skill can run standalone.

### Optional Artifacts
| Artifact | Source | Benefit |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `product-context.md` | icp-research (from `hungv47/marketing-skills`) | Industry context, user personas, and constraints |
| `task-breakdown.md` | task-breakdown | Feature list already decomposed into buildable units |
| `solution-design.md` | solution-design (from `hungv47/research-skills`) | Business initiatives and constraints from strategy track |
| `.agents/design/user-flow.md` | user-flow (from `hungv47/product-skills`) | User flow diagrams for API endpoint design and feature scoping |

### Two Modes of Operation

**Mode 1: Tech Stack Already Chosen**
User provides tech stack upfront. Skip stack-selection-agent. Focus on schema, API, file structure, and implementation details.

**Mode 2: Need Tech Stack Recommendations**
User needs help choosing stack. Run stack-selection-agent first, then chain remaining agents.

### Architecture Interview
If the user provides only a vague description ("build me an app", "I need a platform"):

1. What is the product and its core value proposition?
2. Who are the primary users? Expected concurrent users at launch and at 12 months?
3. What are the 3-5 critical user flows?
4. What data needs to be stored and queried?
5. Existing tech stack or team skill constraints?
6. Specific integrations needed? (payments, email, auth providers, etc.)
7. Performance requirements? (real-time updates, complex queries, offline support)
8. Security/compliance needs? (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI)

All 8 answers are necessary before dispatching agents.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | INSTEAD |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Premature microservices | Adds operational complexity before product-market fit | Start monolith, extract services at pain points |
| Schema without queries | Tables look clean but critical queries require full scans | Design schema around access patterns via schema-agent |
| Auth as afterthought | Retrofitting permissions breaks existing flows | api-agent defines roles and permissions before endpoint design |
| Missing error states | Happy-path-only architecture crumbles in production | scaling-agent traces failure modes for every critical operation |
| "We'll add monitoring later" | Debugging production without observability is guesswork | infrastructure-agent includes logging and error tracking in v1 |
| Over-engineering for scale | Building for 1M users when you have 100 wastes months | scaling-agent designs for 10x current load, plans for 100x |

---

## Worked Example

**User:** "I need architecture for a SaaS invoicing tool. Small businesses send invoices, clients pay online. Need Stripe integration."

**Orchestrator gathers context:**
- Users: business owners (send invoices), clients (view/pay)
- Scale: ~500 businesses, ~2000 invoices/month at launch
- Integrations: Stripe for payments, SendGrid for email
- Constraints: small team, fast launch needed

**Layer 1 dispatch (parallel):**
- `stack-selection-agent` → recommends Next.js + Supabase + Clerk + Stripe + Vercel
- `infrastructure-agent` → plans Vercel deployment, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Sentry monitoring

**Layer 2 chain (sequential):**
- `schema-agent` → designs businesses, invoices, payments, clients tables with indexes on (business_id, status) and (stripe_payment_id)
- `api-agent` → maps POST /api/invoices (business_owner), GET /api/pay/:token (public), POST /api/webhooks/stripe (stripe_signature)
- `integration-agent` → designs file structure, Stripe checkout flow, SendGrid email integration
- `scaling-agent` → identifies invoice PDF generation as first bottleneck at 10x, traces webhook failure modes

**Critic review:** PASS — all 7 quality gates pass.

**Artifact saved to `.agents/system-architecture.md` with all 12 sections.**
