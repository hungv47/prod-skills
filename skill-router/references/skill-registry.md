## Disambiguation: Commonly Confused Skills

### icp-research vs. market-research
- **icp-research:** YOUR audience — personas, pain points, VoC quotes, habitats
- **market-research:** THE market — competitors, sizing, trends, whitespace
- **Rule:** "Who are we selling to?" → icp-research. "What does the market look like?" → market-research.
- **Both needed?** Yes — they run in parallel and feed independently into solution-design.

### copywriting vs. content-create
- **copywriting:** CRAFT quality — headlines, hooks, CTAs with rubric scoring and annotations
- **content-create:** ASSET production — full carousel, thread, email, blog in platform-native format
- **Rule:** Polished headline → copywriting. Complete LinkedIn carousel → content-create.
- **Together:** content-create often calls copywriting internally for key lines.

### plan-interviewer vs. system-architecture vs. task-breakdown
- **plan-interviewer:** Clarify WHAT to build (interviews the user, produces spec.md)
- **system-architecture:** Design HOW to build it (tech stack, schema, API → system-architecture.md)
- **task-breakdown:** Decompose into STEPS (granular tasks with acceptance criteria → tasks.md)
- **Rule:** Unclear idea → plan-interviewer → system-architecture → task-breakdown. Never skip architecture before tasks.
- **plan-interviewer is interactive** — uses AskUserQuestion for multi-round interviews.

### solution-design vs. funnel-planner vs. experiment
- **solution-design:** WHAT initiatives to pursue (ICE scoring, prioritization)
- **funnel-planner:** WHAT numbers to hit (backward from revenue to traffic)
- **experiment:** HOW to validate before committing (A/B, pilot, cohort)
- **Rule:** solution-design picks the bets → funnel-planner sets the targets → experiment tests the bets.

### lp-optimization vs. copywriting (for landing pages)
- **lp-optimization:** AUDIT an existing page for conversion problems (hero, CTA, trust, UX)
- **copywriting:** WRITE new landing page copy from scratch
- **Rule:** Page exists and underperforms → lp-optimization. Building a new page → copywriting.

### humanize vs. copywriting
- **humanize:** POLISH existing text — strip AI patterns, inject voice, compress
- **copywriting:** WRITE new text from scratch with craft quality
- **Rule:** Text already written but sounds robotic → humanize. Need new copy → copywriting.

### attribution vs. funnel-planner
- **attribution:** MEASURE what marketing is working (map activities to outcomes)
- **funnel-planner:** SET targets (model funnel stages, define success metrics)
- **Rule:** "What should our conversion targets be?" → funnel-planner. "Which channels are driving conversions?" → attribution.

### plan-interviewer Route C vs. Route A/B
- **Route C (Quick Scope):** SCOPE an existing task — 5 assumption-surfacing questions + 4-part success contract (GOAL/CONSTRAINTS/FORMAT/FAILURE). Lightweight, ~5 min.
- **Route A/B (Full Interview):** DISCOVER what to build — multi-round interviews to produce a full spec from scratch. ~30 min.
- **Rule:** Task exists but approach unclear → Route C. Vague idea needs a full spec → Route A/B.
- **Together:** Route A/B first (produce spec.md), then Route C on individual features within the spec.

### multi-lens debate vs. multi-lens poll
- **debate:** Agents READ each other's responses and ARGUE across rounds. Produces convergence through disagreement.
- **poll:** Agents work INDEPENDENTLY with varied framings. Produces consensus through aggregation.
- **Rule:** Trade-off decision with no clear answer → debate. Need to filter hallucinations / find the mode → poll.

### review-chain vs. code-cleanup
- **review-chain:** CHECK quality — spawn a fresh-eyes reviewer, then resolve issues found. Does not restructure.
- **code-cleanup:** RESTRUCTURE code — refactor for readability, remove dead code, simplify. Changes structure.
- **Rule:** "Is this code correct?" → review-chain. "Make this code cleaner." → code-cleanup.
- **Together:** code-cleanup first (restructure), then review-chain (verify the restructuring didn't break anything).

## Parallel Track Mappings

Skills that can run simultaneously (no shared dependencies):

| Parallel Pair | Why Parallel | Common Phase |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| `market-research` + `problem-analysis` | Both consume `product-context.md` independently, both feed `solution-design` | Research |
| `brand-system` + `imc-plan` | Both consume `product-context.md` + `icp-research.md`, no dependency on each other | Planning |
| `brand-system` + `funnel-planner` | Both consume `solution-design.md`, no dependency on each other | Planning |
| `lp-optimization` + `seo` | Both audit the same assets from different angles (conversion vs. search) | Optimization |
| `code-cleanup` + `technical-writer` | Both are standalone horizontal skills, no shared artifacts | Quality |
| `icp-research` + `market-research` | Both are entry-point research skills with no shared dependencies | Foundation |

These mappings are encoded in each skill's `routing.parallel-with` frontmatter field and should be used by the team-composer-agent when constructing phases.

```

Horizontal skills (copywriting, lp-optimization, seo, humanize, attribution, code-cleanup, technical-writer, multi-lens, review-chain) can be called at any point — they read upstream artifacts but don't block downstream skills.

> **Note:** multi-lens and review-chain are domain-agnostic process wrappers that compose with any skill in any stack. `preflight` scope-locking is `/plan-interviewer scope` (Route C).
